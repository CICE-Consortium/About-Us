# CICE Consortium: Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and
maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-
free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, political affiliation, veteran
status, pregnancy, genetic information, personal appearance, choice of text editor or
operating system, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, or any other
characteristic protected under applicable US federal or state law. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Refusing to use the pronouns that someone requests
* Intimidating, threatening, or hostile conduct; physical or verbal abuse; vandalism; arson; and sabotage
* Alarming or threatening comments that might refer to, suggest, or promote a violent, intimidating, or threatening action

## Our Responsibilities

The CICE Consortium is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and 
is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of 
unacceptable behavior.

The CICE Consortium has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this 
Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors 
that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an 
individual is representing the project or its community. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the
[Community Liaison or Lead Coordinator](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/wiki/Contacting-the-Consortium) 
or individual CICE Consortium members, who will then have the responsibility to talk about the behavior to the other members of the Consortium. 
The Lead Coordinator and Team Leads will review and investigate all complaints, 
and will respond in a way that they deem appropriate to the circumstances. The 
Lead Coordinator has final authority on addressing complaints. All members of the project
team are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. 
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Retaliation 
against a person who initiates a complaint or an inquiry about such behaviors is equally 
prohibited.

CICE Consortium members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may 
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's 
leadership.
