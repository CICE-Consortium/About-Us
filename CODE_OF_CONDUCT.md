# CICE Consortium: Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
_The Contributor Code of Conduct is for participants in our software projects and community._

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
we, as contributors, creators, stewards, and maintainers (participants), of the CICE Consortium
pledge to make participation in our software, system or hardware project and community a safe, productive, 
welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone.
All participants are required to abide by this Code of Conduct.
This includes respectful treatment of everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression,
level of experience, nationality, political affiliation, veteran status, pregnancy, genetic information, physical appearance, 
race, religion, or sexual orientation, as well as any other characteristic protected under applicable US federal or state law.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

* All participants are treated with respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions
* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative
* Communicate openly with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals and gracefully accepting criticism
* Acknowledge the contributions of others
* Avoid personal attacks directed toward other participants
* Respect the rules and policies of the project and venue

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
* Physical, verbal, or written abuse by anyone to anyone, including repeated use of pronouns other than those requested
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Personal attacks directed at other guests, members, participants, etc.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images 
* Threatening or stalking anyone, including a participant
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the CICE Consortium whether they be physical, online or face-to-face.
This includes project code, code repository, associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media accounts, and any other forums created by the CICE Consortium team which the community uses for communication.
In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

## Community Responsibilities
Everyone in the community is empowered to respond to people who are showing unacceptable behavior.
They can talk to them privately or publicly.
Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If the behavior continues concerns may be brought to the Lead Coordinator, Team Leads, or to any other party listed in the [Reporting](#reporting) section below.

## Administrator Responsibilities
CICE Consortium administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are encouraged to model appropriate behavior and provide support when people in the community point out inappropriate behavior.
The Lead Coordinator and Team Leads are normally the ones that would be tasked to carry out the actions in the [Consequences](#consequences) section below.

## Reporting
Instances of unacceptable behavior may also be reported directly by contacting 
[Community Liaison or Lead Coordinator](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/wiki/Contacting-the-Consortium)
or individual CICE Consortium members.

The Lead Coordinator and Team Leads will review and investigate all complaints,
and may take any action as outlined in the [Consequences](#consequences) section below.
The Lead Coordinator has final authority on addressing complaints.

All members of the CICE Consortium team are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Retaliation against a person who initiates a complaint or an inquiry about such behaviors is equally
prohibited.

## Consequences
Upon receipt of a complaint, the Lead Coordintor and Team Leads may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
Such action can include things such as: removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, email, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or banning temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
