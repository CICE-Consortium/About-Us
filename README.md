# About the CICE Consortium

The Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) is the result of an effort to develop a computationally efficient sea ice component for use in fully coupled, atmosphere-ice-ocean-land global circulation models. Its development and maintenance have been led and coordinated by the Department of Energy since the early 1990s. Over the past two decades, a broad community of climate and weather forecasting groups has adopted the code, and in many cases, enhanced it. 

As the Department of Energy continues to develop a next generation of climate models for energy, continued support of CICE is needed while the community continues to improve and use the model.  Therefore, a group of CICE’s stakeholders and primary developers has formed a new sea ice modeling Consortium as a vehicle for collaboration and sharing, to maintain the current CICE model for existing and new users, to incorporate and maintain new research and development, and to accelerate scientific sea ice model development and its transfer into operational use. 

Although the initial focus of the Consortium is on the CICE sea ice model, there is a desire to continue our collaborations in the longer term, beyond the life of CICE. Therefore the Consortium will be set up as a framework able to evolve with general sea ice model contributions in the future. 

## Who can be a CICE Consortium Member?

Initially, Consortium Members are the entities (agencies or institutions) that are contributing in-kind FTE funding to support the CICE model as part of the Consortium. Each entity is responsible for maintaining part of the code and assisting others to incorporate new code developments.  In 2017, Consortium Members are

DOE Los Alamos National Laboratory  
DoD Naval Postgraduate School  
DoD Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center  
Environment and Climate Change Canada  
NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory  
NOAA National Weather Service  
NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research

CICE developers who are not affiliated with Consortium Members will be able to access the code and contribute their developments for use by the community, via the Consortium's procedures and with help from Consortium Members. The role of the Consortium is not to develop the model, but to aid the community in its development of the code. (Consortium Members may also develop the code under non-Consortium funding streams.)

## About our github project space

*The project space is still under construction.*

Four repositories reside in <https://github.com/CICE-Consortium>:   

**About-Us**:  General information about the Consortium, including Governance and policy documents   
**CICE**: the primary CICE code repository   
**Icepack**:  the sea ice column physics, suitable for inclusion in other sea ice models; Icepack is included in CICE as a git submodule   
**CICE-svn-trunk**:  the entire trunk of the previous subversion repository, including prior releases 

Private branches from the svn repository have been archived; contact the Lead Coordinator if you need access.

For further information, see the ‘wiki’ tab within each CICE-Consortium repository page on github, e.g.
https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/About-Us/wiki.
The wikis contain links to data relevant to each repository along with information about how to interact with the Consortium, such as reporting bugs and developing code.
