## Overview

The CICE Consortium is a group of stakeholders and primary developers of the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE), formed 
*to maintain the current CICE model for existing and new users, to incorporate and maintain new research and development, and to accelerate scientific sea ice model development and its transfer into operational use.*

The CICE model is the result of an effort to develop a computationally efficient sea ice component for use in fully coupled, atmosphere-ice-ocean-land global circulation models. Its development and maintenance have been led and coordinated by the Department of Energy since the early 1990s. Over the past two decades, a broad community of climate and weather forecasting groups has adopted the code, and in many cases, enhanced it. As the Department of Energy continues to develop a next generation of climate models for energy, continued support of CICE is needed while the community continues to improve and use the model.  Therefore, the CICE Consortium has formed as a vehicle for collaboration in sea ice model development. 

Although the initial focus of the Consortium is on the CICE sea ice model, there is a desire to continue our collaborations in the longer term, beyond the life of CICE. Therefore the Consortium will be set up as a framework able to evolve with general sea ice model contributions in the future. 

## Our github project space
Five repositories reside in <https://github.com/CICE-Consortium>:   

**About-Us**:  General information about the Consortium, including Governance and policy documents   
**CICE**: the primary CICE code repository   
**Icepack**:  the sea ice column physics, suitable for inclusion in other sea ice models; Icepack is included in CICE as a git submodule   
**Test-Results**:  Output from our testing scripts for both CICE and Icepack
**CICE-svn-trunk**:  the entire trunk of the previous subversion repository, including prior releases.
   Private branches from the svn repository have been archived; contact the Lead Coordinator if you need access.
